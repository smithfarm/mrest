MREST stands for "minimalistic" or "mechanical" REST server. (Mechanical
because it relies on Web::Machine.)

Web::MREST provides a fully functional REST server that can be
started with a simple command. Without modification, the server provides a
set of generalized resources that can be used to demonstrate how the REST
server works, or for testing.

Developers can use Web::MREST as a platform for implementing
their own REST servers, as described below. App::Dochazka::REST
is one example of such a server.

For an introduction to REST and Web Services, see Web::MREST::WebServicesIntro.
